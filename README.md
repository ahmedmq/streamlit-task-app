# Streamlit App Analyzer 

This repository contains code for a streamlit app that accepts details about different applications and provides visualization and metrics based on the details. The idea behind this app is to build an application inventory in an enterprise environment that will allow the operations teams to gather insight into the application landscape within the enterprise.

This demo app is specifically created for learning Streamlit and Firebase.
